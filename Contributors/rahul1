Hi everyone!

I am Rahul, a final year B. Tech undergrad at Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College. I am majoring in Computer Science & Engineering.

I am a full stack web developer. I like to develop web apps in my spare time.

I am also a novice competitive programmer, learning the tricks of the game bit-by-bit (pun intended!).

You can find me here.

Cheers!
